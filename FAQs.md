**Jarvide frequently asked questions**

**Is there a file limit?**
    
    As of yet, there is no file limit. However, if there becomes an issue of lack of space, there will be a 15 file limit cap and 10mb per file. This can be avoided by purchasing premium for the bot, which allows for 50 files and no filesize limit.

**Why does Jarvide have premium?**

    Jarvide strives to be as free as possible, however with little money to afford a better database plan, storage is limited. That is the only reason that paying for exclusive gives more files; each contribution towards the database helps alot.

**Where does the money I donate go?**

    All money donated goes into helping maintain and develop the bot. This includes advancing filesystems, buying better plans and stretching domains.


**When will Jarvide Exclusive be released?**

    We are not sure when Jarvide Exclusive will be released, maybe weeks, maybe months.

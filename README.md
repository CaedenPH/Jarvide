## **Privacy**

1) **What data does this bot store?**<br>
   - Discord
     - User inputted files
     - User ID related to user settings
   - Dashboard
     - WIP

2) **Why do we need the data, and why do we use this data?**<br>
    Considering the bot is an ide, it stores files that users inputted when running the `IDE` command.
    <br>The database is secure,
    with encryption meaning it can only be viewed by the user.

3) **Other than Discord, do we share your data with any 3rd parties?**<br>
No, we do not share data with any 3rd parties!

4) **How can users get data removed, or how can users contact the bot owner?**<br>
They can contact me, `Caeden#7205` as my friend requests are open.

Keep in mind the whole bot is open source so you are more than welcome to look into the source code on what we do with your data.

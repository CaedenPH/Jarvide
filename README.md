## **About Jarvide**
> **Welcome to Jarvide! A powerful AI mixed with a powerful IDE. Jarvide is the future.**

### **Creation of Jarvide**
> **Jarvide is a creation of pure inspiration made to solve the problems of a developer. Our team decided it was the right time and right place to start developing an IDE which also has chat bot functionalities. Balanced as all things should be.** <br>

**Jarvis**
> Jarvis is an ai from Iron Man that executes commands and retrieves informaton via normal, logical speaking. A phrase like "hey jarvis, can you kick Caeden please" would kick member Caeden, or if there are multiple give an option of which one. 


**Text editor (IDE)**
> Have you used the linux commandline editor, nano? The text editor part of jarvis implements safe, reliable and fast filesystems with editing and compiling technology. The idea is that you can upload or create files and these files would be saved into a filesystem which you can open at any time. If you have an open file you can compile it and run it(depending on the filetype). You can also edit the content and replace text. You can also pull and push to github depending on the file/folder you uploaded.

<h2><b>The Golden Rules of Contributing</b></h2>
1. Make great commits. Following PEP8 and it should be atomic, with a commit message explaining what and why.
2. Do not open a pull request if you aren't assigned to the issue. If someone is already working on it, consider offering to collaborate with that person.
3. Use assets licensed for public use. Whenever the assets are images, audio or even code, they must have a license compatible with our projects.
